Section viewing and editing
###########################

This plugin provides mapcanvases to view and edit layers in the third dimension

Linestrings on the standard xy QGIS canvas are used to define the section. Features within a given distance are projected on the section and can be edited. Edited features are snapped to the section "plane".
